# def is the syntax for creating a new function
# gcd is our new function for greatest common denominator
# a and b are the two parameters we'll use later
# the body of the function needs to be indented (4 spaces is an indent); if there are functions within functions indenting keeps happening

def gcd(a, b):
    while (b != 0):  # NOT equal to zero because you can't divide by zero; if b is zero it will skip all of the indented code
        temp = a  # value of a is going into a temporary value
        a = b  # because the greatest common denominator will be the same number
        b = temp % b  # modulo gives remainder only
        # if b is zero this loop will stop and the next step (return) will occur
        # the step-by-step math of this Euclid Algorithm is explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUzYl1TYMcU
    return a

# testing the function:
print(gcd(60, 96))  # the result that returns is 12
print(gcd(20, 8))  # the result that returns is 4
